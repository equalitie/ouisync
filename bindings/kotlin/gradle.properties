# The version of the Kotlin bindings consist of the version of the rust library followed by dash and
# followed by "revision" (e.g.: "1.2.3-4"). The revision is used to distinguish different versions
# of the bindings which use the same version of the rust library. When the bindings change but not
# to the rust library, increment the revision. When the rust library changes (and so its version
# changes as well), reset the revision back to zero.
